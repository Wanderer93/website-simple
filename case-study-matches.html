            <p class="section-text">Infringements can damage a brand's reputation and hurt consumers with dangerous goods. The company helps brands identify and take down infringing items, but analysts' work can be slow and manual.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Reviewing images faster</h2>
            <p class="section-text">I was working on an easier way to review images that belong to a suspicious post or website.
            <br><br>A suspicious marketplace post could have 5 to 15 images on average, but a suspicious website could have 50. How could we show all these images alongside insights that help analysts review and label infringements quickly?</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Deep-diving into an image through the Matches Modal</h2>
            <p class="section-text">While I was doing the quick improvement above, I saw that each image allows the user to:
            <br>- Zoom to review details.
            <br>- Open the Matches modal that deep-dives into why the image is suspicious.
            <br>(Did OCR detect a suspicious keyword? Was it a logo? Was it similar to a known official image?)
            <br>This helps analysts understand matching reasons, unmatch incorrect ones, and find similar images to flag more posts.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The change that increased discoverability by 1500%.</h2>
            <p class="section-text">I added a "See Matches" button, visible on hover. This simple addition significantly increased interaction with the modal.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Modal opens plummet... then rise to 1500%</h2>
            <p class="section-text">From a few opens per day, the stats plummeted to zero. It turned out the data segments tracked only internal users like devs and QA. Once fixed, usage surged.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Much more to learn!</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Next steps would have been to study how people use image recognition filters. Why didnâ€™t users unmatch images? Were matches correct? Did people understand the feature? The software was discontinued after an acquisition, so the exploration stopped there.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Bonus level: the design system</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Efficient, scalable design systems are essential. I started optimizing components in Figma and worked closely with developers to build them in Storybook.</p>
