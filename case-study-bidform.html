            <h2 class="section-title">The form nobody wanted to fill in</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Sales and sourcing need to be in contact tightly. Selling a research project means also sourcing the right participants, for the right price, or the company won't make a profit. They communicated with a legacy bid form nobody wanted to fill in - endlessly scrolling, shifting fields. Sales people were checking a couple of random boxes and inputting all the project information in a large text box at the bottom, starting a long email chain of back-and-forth for clarifications.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Business impact: better profit margins</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Faster communication between sales and sourcing means cutting down on operational costs of the back-and-forth, but also getting better project profit margins.<br>There's an additional benefit: in the large end-to-end system, inputting correct project data in the beginning of the process means it can be used downstream, saving time and costs and providing even more transparency and efficiencies. For example, a researcher in the field can compare their participant data with the accurate information provided by sales and sourcing, instead of filling in everything from scratch again.</p>

            <p class="section-text">We saw during research that people liked to input all data in a large text box at the bottom. I collaborated with a data scientist - he made an API endpoint for a ChatGPT wrapper that could take a salesperson freeform description of an audience and fill out step 2 of the form - the audience profile. I used Storybook and Chromatic to enhance my coded prototype and allow for this free form auto fill</p>
